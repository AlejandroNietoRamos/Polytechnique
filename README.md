2016 École Polytechnique Internship Reports.
Advisor: Marc Lavielle.

These are the the two technical reports written during my internship at École Polytechnique in the summer of 2016. 

The first report is about the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm (SAEM).

The second report is about a model reduction made to a tumoral growth model using the Monolix software from Lixoft.
